##Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

#This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The script,  run_analysis.R , does the following:
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## step 1: load data into R 
## step 2: merge train and test data
## step 3: Set name to variable
#2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
## step 1: Subset name of features by measurement on the mean and standard deviation
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## step 1: load activity data into R & factorize ActivityData(variable) using descriptive names
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
## step 1: Defining descriptive names for all variables.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
